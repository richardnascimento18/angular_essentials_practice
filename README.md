# 📌 Angular Course - First Module Project

Welcome to my **Angular Course - First Module Project** repository! 🚀  
This project is part of my journey learning **Angular**, covering fundamental concepts like **Directives, Components, Services, and more!**

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Directives

Angular directives extend HTML with custom behaviors. Used for **structural changes (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`)** and **attribute modifications (`[ngClass]`, `[ngStyle]`)**.

### 🔹 Property Binding

One-way data binding that dynamically updates element properties using **`[property]`** syntax.

### 🔹 Angular Components

Reusable building blocks of an Angular application, defined using `@Component`. Each component consists of an **HTML template, TypeScript logic, and CSS styling**.

### 🔹 Angular Services

Used for **shared logic and dependency injection**, making data and functions available across components.

### 🔹 @Output, @Input, @Component Decorators

- **`@Input()`** → Allows passing data **from parent to child components**.
- **`@Output()`** → Emits events **from child to parent components**.
- **`@Component()`** → Defines metadata for a component, such as template, selector, and styles.

### 🔹 Signals

A reactive approach in Angular to manage state updates efficiently without performance issues.

### 🔹 String Interpolation & Two-way Binding (`ngModel`)

- **String Interpolation (`{{ }}`)** → Displays dynamic values in templates.
- **Two-way Binding (`ngModel`)** → Synchronizes data between the **model and the UI**.

### 🔹 Custom Event Emitters

Allow components to **emit custom events** using `EventEmitter` and `@Output()` for better communication.

### 🔹 Dependency Injection

A design pattern used in Angular for **injecting services** into components and other services to **manage dependencies efficiently**.

### 🔹 Slots with `ng-content`

Allows components to use **content projection**, meaning they can receive and display **dynamic content from their parent**.

### 🔹 Model Interfaces (TypeScript)

Define **strict data structures** for components, ensuring **type safety and better code maintainability**.
